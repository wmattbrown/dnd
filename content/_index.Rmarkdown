This website was built to track the progress of the Dungeons and Dragons campaign that started mid-late 2019. I (Willy) didn't join until January 2020 so information prior to that point is quite scarce. Feel free to suggest fixes/changes to any page or request a new page be added so you can add content to it. Each page has a GitHub link to the repo for this site where you can suggest changes via a 'pull request'.
